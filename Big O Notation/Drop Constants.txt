def print_items(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)
    for j in range(n):
        print(j)

in this case first loop we are running from i until n, and in the second loop we are running from j to n, so in both of them are identical, except we have used i and j

so as per this coding it will printed for i = 0 to 9 and then j = 0 to 9, in the case also use O(n) time complexity
